# Scout Analytics Platform - Development History

## Lessons Learned from v3.3.0 Deployment

### Root Issue: Branch/Version Mismatch
**Problem:** Vercel production was pinned to `release/v3.2.0` branch while code was v3.3.0

**Solution Applied:**
1. Created explicit VERSION file with "3.3.0"
2. Created `release/v3.3.0` branch at commit e0532a3
3. Tagged as v3.3.0
4. Forced clean build deployment

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Always verify branch alignment before deployment claims
- Use VERSION file for explicit version tracking
- Create release branches for each version
- Verify all version indicators show consistently

### Deployment Verification Requirements
**Problem:** Multiple false success claims without proper verification

**Solution Applied:**
- Build logs showing completion
- Live URL responding with actual content
- Screenshot or curl output as evidence
- Specific success criteria met

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Never claim success without proof
- Wait minimum 90 seconds for deployment
- Check build logs for "Success" or "Ready"
- Verify with curl and content validation

### Full-Stack vs Frontend-Only
**Problem:** Initial deployment was "just tailwind which is useless"

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `/app/api/dashboard/route.ts` for backend data
- Added `/app/api/brand-intelligence/route.ts` for BrandBot AI
- Added `/app/api/analytics/route.ts` for advanced analytics
- Updated frontend to use real API calls

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Always implement backend API routes for data
- Use proper API integration with fallback mechanisms
- Test full-stack functionality before deployment claims

## RepoAgent Implementation

### Purpose
Implemented RepoAgent to prevent repeat deployment issues by:
1. Cherry-picking successful patterns from other repositories
2. Embedding lessons learned into project documentation
3. Automating CI/CD improvements based on past failures

### Files Added
- `agents/repo.yaml` - RepoAgent configuration
- `agents/prompts/repo.txt` - Agent prompt and instructions
- `src/agents/repo_agent.ts` - Core RepoAgent logic
- `.github/workflows/repo-agent-ci.yml` - CI integration
- Updated `.pulserrc` to include repo agent

### Claude-Code CLI Session Integration
This HISTORY.md file now serves as the central repository for embedding Claude-Code CLI session snippets and deployment lessons to ensure traceability and prevent recurrence of past deployment failures.
